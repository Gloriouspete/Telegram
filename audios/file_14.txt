Welcome to Gradle 8.0.1!

Here are the highlights of this release:
 - Improvements to the Kotlin DSL
 - Fine-grained parallelism from the first build with configuration cache
 - Configurable Gradle user home cache cleanup

For more details see https://docs.gradle.org/8.0.1/release-notes.html

Configuration on demand is an incubating feature.

However we cannot choose between the following variants of project :react-native-camera:
          - generalReleaseRuntimeElements
          - mlkitReleaseRuntimeElements
        All of them match the consumer attributes:
          - Variant 'generalReleaseRuntimeElements' capability Perks:react-native-camera:unspecified declares a component for use during runtime, as well as attribute 'com.android.build.api.attributes.AgpVersionAttr' with value '7.4.2', attribute 'com.android.build.api.attributes.BuildTypeAttr' with value 'release':
              - Unmatched attributes:
                  - Provides attribute 'com.android.build.api.attributes.ProductFlavor:react-native-camera' with value 'general' but the consumer didn't ask for it
                  - Provides attribute 'com.android.build.gradle.internal.attributes.VariantAttr' with value 'generalRelease' but the consumer didn't ask for it
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for Android)
                  - Provides attribute 'react-native-camera' with value 'general' but the consumer didn't ask for it
          - Variant 'mlkitReleaseRuntimeElements' capability Perks:react-native-camera:unspecified declares a component for use during runtime, as well as attribute 'com.android.build.api.attributes.AgpVersionAttr' with value '7.4.2', attribute 'com.android.build.api.attributes.BuildTypeAttr' with value 'release':

                  - Provides attribute 'react-native-camera' with value 'mlkit' but the consumer didn't ask for it
        The following variants were also considered but didn't match the requested attributes:
          - Variant 'generalDebugApiElements' capability Perks:react-native-camera:unspecified declares a component, as well as attribute 'com.android.build.api.attributes.AgpVersionAttr' with value '7.4.2':
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component for use during compile-time, as well as attribute 'com.android.build.api.attributes.BuildTypeAttr' with value 'debug' and the consumer needed a component for use during runtime, as well as attribute 'com.android.build.api.attributes.BuildTypeAttr' with value 'release'
              - Other compatible attribute:
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for Android)
